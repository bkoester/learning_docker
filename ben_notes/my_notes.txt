These are notes about how I got this booted up. I mostly followed this website:

https://davetang.org/muse/2022/12/07/running-rstudio-server-on-amazon-ec2/

The whole program is that you will create EC2 instance, with an open an ssh port, an open TCP port for the RStudio server, and an SSH key-pair, then update the EC2 instance and install the docker container. Then you just connect from your browser.

1) First you have to spin up an EC2 instance with Ubuntu
 - this is basically what RStudio and docker both work well on.
2) Create or use an existing key-pair for SSHing in, which is a quick way to install (no Cloud9)
3) Pick a gp2 volume of at least 10GB by default, t2.medium.
4) in the security group, set ssh to 0.0.0.0/0 source, and another TCP to port 8889, with the source as MyIP address.
5) ssh in with your key, follow the docker.com steps for installing docker on Ubuntu
6) create an ubuntu user (following D. Tang)
7) clone dtang's fork (or this one if that one goes away)
8) run .run_rstudio.sh
9) find your instance's IP and use port 8889
10) stop/restart as needed.
